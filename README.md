# About
**The following will be broken down by sections**

### Overall
Initially I was going to make this app with shades of whites an grays, and take a fair bit of my inspiration from 
[Adham Dannaway's](https://www.adhamdannaway.com/) page but decided not to in the end. White, blue, and gray colors typically give off 
more modern vibes which typically work for developes, but I like green and I don't want my website to look like anybody elses. If I did I 
would've used a web builder.

### Header
The Header honestly wasn't too difficult to make, especially since I designed the whole app before building which saved me a ridiculous
ammount of burn out. I figured I'd let some of my personality show here, and yes "Dork" is very much an alias. My *chef's kiss* to the header is just the gradient "border" which is just a background with some extra padding. I felt clever and it looks very nice.

### Projects
This is probably the only thing that had some influence from [Adham's](https://www.adhamdannaway.com/) site atleast with shape. My spin 
on it was just the 3d animation to flip the card over to show some information about the projects while also allowing users to visit the 
site and it's code.

### About Me
This was obviously more serious, and not to special of a component. Just a simple Div and media queries.

### Skills
Same deal as the About section, I show my technical and soft skills, and use `swiper/react` to add in making it more mobile friendly.

### Journey
*This* is my pride and joy of this project. Using framer-motion cards will translate a given number of pixels left and right depending 
on their order as well as rotate. This effect occurs when `effect` is equal to "fan" which cause the cards to fan out as seen. and even 
cooler that occurs when the component is brought into view `IntersectionObserver`.

"But wait there's more!" - Billy Mays, upon clicking the cards display out allowing users to read my web development journey and it all looks **really cool**.

### Footer 
Not nearly as interesting as the Journey Section, but hey if there's any recruiters or tech leads reading this my email is 
**geo.rapeta@gmail.com** clicking on the email in footer should also directly send you to your default emailing app so that you can reach out to me. I'm more likely to respond this way than I am via phone#.
